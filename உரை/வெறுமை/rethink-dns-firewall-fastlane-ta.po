"Say hello to a safer, transparent, and secure Android.\n"
"\n"
"VPN: Connects to multiple WireGuard VPNs of your choice.\n"
"\n"
"Safe: Reveals network activity of installed apps and lets you disable, "
"uninstall, or firewall them.\n"
"\n"
"Secure: First line of defense against spyware, ransomware, and malware that "
"steal personal information and takeover accounts. Protects from DNS "
"manipulation typically employed to censor websites, social media, and "
"messaging apps.\n"
"\n"
"Fast: DNS Servers deployed to 300+ locations world-wide to ensure your "
"internet is as fast and highly available as it can be.\n"
"\n"
"Open: Open source and free of any trackers.\n"
"\n"
"***Features***\n"
"\n"
"Firewall: Prevent apps from connecting to the Internet. Block spyware, "
"malware, ransomware and more.\n"
"     \n"
"A firewall blocks any app connecting to the Internet over WiFi or Mobile "
"data. Since most forms of surveillance require the data to be sent the "
"network to a server, firewalling them effectively mitigates the threat (File "
"Managers, Alarm Clock, Calculator are few such examples of apps that do not "
"require any Internet access to function). The firewall feature uses "
"Accessibility Service to detect and firewall background applications.\n"
"\n"
"Monitoring: Keep tabs on incoming and outgoing Internet traffic. \n"
"\n"
"If enabled, the connectivity logs are collected and analyzed. Automated "
"reports flag previously unknown or suspicious connections, and reveal the "
"extent of attempt to steal data by spyware networks. In our tests, around "
"60% of the traffic is flagged and reported as being initiated by known "
"spyware. Logs generated are made available in near-real time to the user for "
"their own analysis.\n"
"\n"
"WireGuard: Secure outgoing Internet traffic.\n"
"\n"
"The app uses fast, modern, light-weight, and secure WireGuard protocol to "
"encrypt outgoing connections to any compatible VPN provider of your choice.\n"
"\n"
"Anti-censorship: \n"
"\n"
"The app encrypts your internet connection to Domain Name System (DNS) server "
"run by Rethink with presence in our 300+ locations world-wide. DNS servers "
"are the address book of the internet: A DNS server provides the exact "
"addresses you need to visit a website or open an app.\n"
"\n"
"Data Monitor: Track per-app and per-connection Mobile or WiFi data usage."
