"The Low Surdo is very important in this tune because it gives the special "
"hip hop rhythm and “carries” the tune. There are different versions on the "
"tune sheets but both sound good ;). Since none of the Surdos play at the "
"same time, it is also possible to play this tune with only one or two surdo "
"players and three surdos. To remember the Surdo lines it is also helpful to "
"sing them all together (low, high, middle middle, low, high-low, low, high, "
"middle middle, low, high…)."

"**Musical background:** The baseline of the tune somewhat resembles "
"Drum&Bass, although Drum&Bass is usually played much faster at 165–185 bpm, "
"while RoR Tunes are usually played at around 100–120 bpm. At this speed, the "
"tune more sounds like Hip Hop, and a very similar base line can be heard in "
"several hip hop songs such as this: [YouTube]{1}."

"**History:** First mentioned in 2010 by RoR Bremen. Has been developed on a "
"transnational basis between 2009 & 2010. Barking Bateria also mentions a "
"tune with this name [on their website]{1} in 2006, although it is not clear "
"whether it is the same tune."
