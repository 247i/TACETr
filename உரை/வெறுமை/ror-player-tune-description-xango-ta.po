"Religion: Its origin is the religion of the Yoruba, a Westafrican people / "
"ethnic group connected mainly via language. It‘s believed that there is a "
"Supreme Being known as Olorun or Olodumaré. Several gods called „powers“ are "
"worshipped (intermediary spiritual beings, also called orixas in other "
"religions. Every orixa is connected to a natural phenomenon, colors, food, …)"
". Drumming, dancing and singing are used for rituals, in which for example "
"one deity is called down to manifest by possessing a person. People seek "
"guidance and protection by the orixas through dance, song and sacrifice, the "
"powers are appeased and worshipped."

"During colonization, enslaved people recognized that some of the Catholic "
"saints shared symbols and characteristics with their orixas. They began to "
"identify some of the orixas with these saints, as a method to secretly "
"worship their actual gods while pretending to embrace the faith of their "
"masters. Depending on the region, orixas correspond to different saints. "
"Xangô corresponds to Saint Barbara (she is also associated with lightning "
"and thunder) or Saint Jerome."
