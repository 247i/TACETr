Once up on a time, there lived a little dinosaur name sardar, lived in a village. A boy gives meat to the sardar. And there lived a panda which is very clever and fat.  The boy named the panda as bussyboo and the panda is very very soft and clever. The boy gives bamboo to the bussyboo. 
        One day the bussyboo got fever and the sardar saw the bussyboo. The sardar tried to eat the bussyboo. But when the sardar went
        near to the panda, the boy threw a meat. The sardar saw the meat and started running after it. 
        And the bussyboo started to be lazy. The bussyboo and sardar turned into great friends. One day, the boy
        went to his mother's sister's home. The bussyboo silently came into the car when he was in the home. 
        The bussyboo gave him great surprise and after a few months the bussyboo got many soft babies. 
        The sardar was playing with every bussyboo's babies. He loved to spend time with the bussyboo's babies 
        but one baby was little sad when the sardar came near to the baby. The baby started sleeping but another baby came and woke the
        sleeping baby. And few minutes later, all the babies were sleeping but the bussyboo and sardar was playing. 
        




The End.
