"The terminology of some Magnate actions has been altered for clarity and "
"brevity.  Completely developing a new property is called the \"Buy\" action; "
"purchasing a deed for a new property is called \"Deed\", developing deeds "
"(that is, adding tokens to a deeded property, whether it results in the deed "
"becoming fully developed or not) is called \"Add\".  (Selling a card and "
"trading suit tokens 3 for 1 are unchanged.)\n"
"\n"
"In order to speed up the process of rolling for resources, there are two "
"additional actions:\n"
"* \"Prefer\" is for setting your preference of which suit token to take when "
"a deed pays out on your opponent's roll.  If you do not set an explicit "
"preference, the code will choose the rarer token for you based on your non-"
"crown suits and current supply of tokens.  The currently preferred token is "
"circled in the UI, but your preference is never visible to the other "
"player.\n"
"* \"Choose\" is a mandatory first action for collecting suit tokens when a "
"deed pays out on your own roll.\n"
"In all cases where you need to choose a suit token that is not already among "
"your tokens, you still click on the appropriate token pile.\n"
"\n"
"Note that only the final resource die result is displayed, but the "
"distribution of expected outcomes is still that of rolling 2d10 and taking "
"the higher value.  Taxation happens when the lower of 2d10 comes up 1; a "
"suit die is rolled (or two, in the double taxation variant), and the suit(s) "
"will be displayed underneath the resource result.  The roll is logged at the "
"end of a player's turn, and is attributed to the next player (who would have "
"rolled in the physical game).  Except for a \"Choose\", no user action is "
"required; resources are added and/or removed automatically by the server in "
"between turns.\n"
"\n"
"When a player is ahead in a district, the Pawn or Excuse for that district "
"is outlined in that player's color.  The first tiebreaker score (total "
"property value) is displayed in parentheses after the district score.  The "
"second tiebreaker is total number of tokens remaining."
