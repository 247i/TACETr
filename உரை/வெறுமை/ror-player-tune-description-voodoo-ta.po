"**Name:** The so-called African diaspora religions are religions that "
"evolved from traditional African beliefs and rituals, sometimes with a "
"Christian influence, among African slaves in America. They often had to be "
"practiced in secret. Some of these religions are called Voodoo (sometimes "
"spelled Vodum, Vodou, Vodú). While these religions originate in Africa, some "
"of them (in particular Louisiana Voodoo) are also practicioned by white "
"people. African diaspora religions usually include drumming in their rituals."
