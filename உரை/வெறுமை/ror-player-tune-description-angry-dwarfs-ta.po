"**Name:** The original name of this tune was German „Wütende Heinzelmenschen“"
", which has been translated as “angry dwarfs”. „Heinzelmenschen“ (officially "
"but gendered: „Heinzelmännchen“) are small human creatures in a local tale "
"in Cologne, who, according to the tale, secretly did all the work for the "
"people of Cologne at night, so that the people could be lazy during the day. "
"One day, someone got curious to see them and set up a trap, so they got "
"really angry and left. From that day on the people had to do all the work "
"themselves. ([Wikipedia]{1})"
