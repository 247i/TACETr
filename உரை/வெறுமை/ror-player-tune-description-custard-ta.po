"A lot of this tune is based on the Tamborim’s voice, which can be memorized "
"by “I’ve got custard in my underpants”. When learning the tune, start off "
"there and make sure it’s burnt into everyone’s brain."

"If you are playing Agogô or Tamborim, don’t mix up your voice with the one "
"from afoxe, as they are very similar. Check out the differences and find "

"**Name:** Custard is the English word for a sweet, creamy, puddingy vanilla "
"sauce ([Wikipedia]{1}). The name was chosen because of the memory “I’ve got "

"**Sign:** The sign used to depict a “W” for Welfare State (the former name "
"of the tune), as can be seen in this [video]{1} by RoR London. It changed "
"into the current sign and can also be interpreted as “holding a bowl of "
"custard”."

"The rhythm clearly sounds like Samba Reggae, which is a tune developed and "
"used by the Black liberation movement in Brazil. Many people in the RoR "
"network consider it cultural appropriation to play this tune in our mainly "
"white European bands, and there is an ongoing debate about abolishing the "
"tune."

"Break 3 can be used to have kind of solo parts for instrument sections: Let "
"them continue while the others play Break 3. At the beginning you might need "
"to count the bars in your head to find the transition back to the groove. "
"This is most important for snare players as they have a solo in the last bar."
