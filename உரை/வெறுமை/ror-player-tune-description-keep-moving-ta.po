"**Name:** The name has a double meaning. Literally, this tune serves to keep "
"the group moving. By moving along with the music, you stay in the mood and "
"thus come across as very convincing. It also helps keep the atmosphere right "
"for the whole (action) group. A moving rhythm band is contagious, unlike an "
"unmoving one. The second meaning is perhaps the most important. “Keep moving”"
" in the sense of “stay committed, persevere, resist”. Don't give up the "
"fight, together we stand strong to strive for a climate-just world and take "
"the action needed to raise awareness about current issues among a large part "
"of the population. Don’t give up hope! There have already been many victims, "
"but step by step we are creating a world where every human being, every life "
"on this planet counts. Let’s act for climate justice all over the world! "
"Keep moving!"

"breaks, moments to reflect and (natural) silence."
