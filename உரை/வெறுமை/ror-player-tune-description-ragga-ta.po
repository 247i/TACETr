"The Surdos are the basis, the complete tune is build upon. In five of the "
"six breaks they have a special role; in four of them, they call the call"
"&response-breaks (Break 1, Break 3 and the Kickbacks 1&2) and in the ‘Zorro-"
"Break’ they are the only ones playing, while everyone else just plays along. "
"But also in the groove they have a special position, because they are ("
"except the Agogôs) the only instrument, which plays on beat. Everyone else "
"plays offbeat, thereby the whole tune is somehow turned into a call&response."

"There’s an alternate version of the Repi groove. It sounds quite nice, but "
"can be very tiring, not only for the Repi players, but also for those who "
"listen. Repi players should keep that in mind and change between alternate "
"and normal version."

"The Kick Back Breaks are a call & response between Surdos and all others. "
"While ‘Kick Back 1’ is quite moderate, ‘Kick Back 2’ is quite fast. Using "
"them as Intros, to speed up, or to create tension works really good."

"In the Kick Back 2 the Agogôs have a really hard part (playing sixteenth-"
"notes with only one stick). It should be played accurate and not "
"chaotically. Therefore it might be useful to take turns (one Agogô-player "
"starts while another takes a break and e.g. after eight counts they change). "
"Also, as a maestr@, counting in ‘Kick Back 2’ while stopping the Agogôs and "
"getting them into the tune just a few bars before the next break (or getting "
"into the tune, or whatever), might be helping – and increases tension and "
"energy."
