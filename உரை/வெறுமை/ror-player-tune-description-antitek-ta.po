"**Musical background:** Inspired by the song \"Ode aux casseur/euses\" by "
"\"la chorale des Canulars\" from Lyon. The ode was made in reaction to the "
"media stigmatizing so-called casseur/euses (translated as vandals, rioters. "
"A word used by media to depoliticize anarchist and radical actions). It's an "
"ode to the political actions of these so-called vandals, reminding us that "
"these \"violent\" actions made great victories possible."

"**History:** Antitek was created in a poorly insulated home in Lille during "
"the 2023 French pension reform strikes, which fought against a law project "
"raising the retirement age to 64. As of early 2025, the French state is "
"investing in surveillance assets to break the movement and boost the "
"propaganda for nuclear revival."
