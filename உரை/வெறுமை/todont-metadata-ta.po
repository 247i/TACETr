"<b>A good look at bad habits.</b> Jot down your vices in a tap, right from "
"the home page. Use Notes to add details — like a healthy alternative to that "
"chocolate bar you cannot resist. And organise your input with Labels.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"<b>Faster than you can grab a pen.</b> Find your bad habits on the home "
"page, and cross out the ones you give into. These will move to Done for the "
"day. The next morning, start off fresh with a full list of things to avoid.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"<b>Stay on top of your progress.</b> The Log gives you insight into your "
"overall success rates and pinpoints what bad habit you have been most "
"attached to — over a week, a month, or a year. So you can easily work toward "
"a better you.\n"
