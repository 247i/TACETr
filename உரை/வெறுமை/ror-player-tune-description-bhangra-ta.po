"But be aware of the 6/8 rhythm. On the notation sheet, every step is divided "
"into only 3 hits (instead of 4 in the 4/4). When playing it for the first "
"time, you might have to concentrate in order to not get stuck in the usual 4/"
"4 rhythm. This is particularly important when switching from or into a "
"different tune."

"If you play breaks from other tunes which are based on 16 hits in a 4/4 "
"pattern (eg. “Karla Break”, or “8 Up”), try to play 12 hits in a 3/4 "
"pattern. In the beginning it’s quite hard (because the 4/4 is stuck in your "
"head) but after a while it’s great – make sure tho whole band plays like "
"this, if some plays it differently it can get very chaotic…"

"**Name:** Bhaṅgṛā is a traditional folk dance from Punjab (a region in "
"northern India and eastern Pakistan) ([Wikipedia]{1}). It was typically "
"danced by farmers during the harvesting season, to the beat of a Dhol. Dhols "
"are double-sided drums where one side is hit with a heavy wooden stick, "
"creating a deep sound, and the other side with a light stick, creating a "
"high sound."

"Nowadays, Bhaṅgṛā also refers to a style of pop music that was invented by "
"Punjabi immigrants in Great Britain and North America. Its beat somewhat "
"resembles a faster version of the Dhol rhythm in traditional Bhaṅgṛā "
"drumming ([Wikipedia]{1})."

"**Musical background:** The Surdo and Tamborim lines very closely resemble "
"the rhythm that the low and high side of the Dhol is playing to the "
"traditional Bhaṅgṛā folk dance. Several examples can be found on YouTube "
"when searching for “Bhangra drumming” or “Punjabi drumming” (searching for "
"just “Bhangra” will bring up mostly modern Bhaṅgṛā pop music, where the "
"similarity to our tune is very small)."
