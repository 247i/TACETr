"In this tune, the Low Surdo swaps one of its beaters for a plastic Repinique "
"stick (aka a whippy stick) to get a higher pitched sound. Then it plays a "
"combination of high-pitched and normal hits."

"**Name:** Angela Davis is an Afro-American activist from the USA. She "
"experienced a lot of oppression as a university professor due to her "
"political views and involvement in the black liberation, communist and "
"radical feminist movement. She became a major figure of the prison "
"abolishment movement after being imprisoned for a murder that she did not "
"commit. ([Wikipedia]{1}, see also the documentary “Free Angela & All "
"Political Prisoners”)"

"**History:** Part of the first set of tunes taken from Barking Bateria in "
"2000. The name used to be “James Brown” (famous musician from the USA) and "
"the sign was to depict an afro haircut. James Brown didn’t have an afro "
"haircut for most of his life, but later got one as it became a symbol of "
"Black pride. The tune was renamed because of domestic violence and rape "
"accusations against James Brown, and Angela Davis was chosen because she fit "
"the tune sign. Later the tune sign was changed. We consider both the old "
"tune sign itself and the fact that Angela Davis was chosen because of her "
"afro hair as racist."
