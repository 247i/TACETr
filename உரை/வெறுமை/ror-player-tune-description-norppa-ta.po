"**Name:** Saimaannorppa or Saimaa ringed seal is an endangered animal "
"species that only lives in one lake in Finland. They like to chill out on "
"warm rocks. Norppas were nearly hunted to extinction in the 20th century, as "
"it was considered an enemy to the fishing industry. Conservation began in "
"1979 and saved it from extinction. Since then, it has became the symbol of "
"nature conservation in Finland. Climate change poses a direct threat to the "
"Norppa."
