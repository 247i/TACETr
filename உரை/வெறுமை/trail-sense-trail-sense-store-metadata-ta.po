"<p>Explore beyond the reaches of the Internet with Trail Sense.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<ul>\n"
"    <li>Designed for hiking, backpacking, camping, and geocaching</li>\n"
"    <li>Place beacons and navigate to them</li>\n"
"    <li>Use as a compass (only available on devices with a compass "
"sensor)</li>\n"
"    <li>Follow paths</li>\n"
"    <li>Retrace your steps with backtrack</li>\n"
"    <li>Use a photo as a map</li>\n"
"    <li>Plan what to pack</li>\n"
"    <li>Be alerted before the sun sets</li>\n"
"    <li>Predict the weather (only available on devices with a barometer "
"sensor)</li>\n"
"    <li>Use your phone as a flashlight</li>\n"
"    <li>And much more!</li>\n"
"</ul>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Trail Sense is a tool, and just like any other tool that you bring into "
"the wilderness,\n"
"it's essential to have backup equipment and skills.\n"
"This app is intended for information purposes only and the accuracy of the "
"predictions and sensors are determined by a number of factors, including "
"calibration, sensor quality, external sources, etc.\n"
"Use at your own risk, always have backup tools (ex. compass), and stay "
"safe.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>This app also does not, and will never, use the Internet - all "
"information in Trail Sense comes directly from your phone's sensors, and no "
"data will leave Trail Sense.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3>COMMON ISSUES</h3>\n"
"<ul>\n"
"    <li>No compass: If your phone does not have a compass sensor, there is "
"nothing I can do to make it work because that is hardware.\n"
"    You will still be able to use other features of Trail Sense.</li>\n"
"    <li>No weather: The Weather tool is only available if your phone has a "
"barometer sensor.</li>\n"
"</ul>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Found an issue or want a new feature? Contact me at trailsense@"
"protonmail.com or create a new issue on GitHub: github.com/kylecorry31/Trail-"
"Sense</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>I'm the only developer of Trail Sense, so I will do my best to help out "
"with issues - but I have a limited device selection to test on.</p>\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"<h3>PERMISSIONS</h3>\n"
"<ul>\n"
"    <li>Notifications: Allows Trail Sense to display notifications ("
"backtrack, weather, sunset alerts, astronomy events, water boil timer, "
"etc)</li>\n"
"    <li>Location: Allows Trail Sense to retrieve your location for "
"navigation, weather (sea level calibration), and astronomy.</li>\n"
"    <li>Background location: Allows Trail Sense to retrieve your location "
"for sunset alerts while in the background.\n"
"    On some devices, this will also improve the reliability of backtrack and "
"weather monitor.</li>\n"
"    <li>Physical activity: Allows Trail Sense to use your phone's pedometer "
"for distance calculation.</li>\n"
"    <li>Camera: Allows Trail Sense to use your camera on the sighting "
"compass, clinometer, and for taking photos used by the Cloud Scanner, QR "
"Code Scanner, and Photo Maps.</li>\n"
"    <li>Alarms & reminders: Allows Trail Sense to post a notification at an "
"exact time.\n"
"    This is used by the Clock tool (when updating system time) and Sunset "
"and Sunrise Alerts.</li>\n"
