"**Name:** Hip hop is an art movement that originated in the 1970s from Black "
"and Latino communities in New York. Often only associated with rap, the hip "
"hop culture includes many more elements such as breakdance, graffiti and "
"beatboxing. Originally an underground movement and a tool to protest against "
"the oppressive state institutions, it was discovered in the 1990s by the "
"music industry, who started making huge profits by marketing it towards a "
"white male audience. Over the years, Hip hop has become one of the most "
"popular genres of music worldwide, and not much is left of its original "
"purpose. Some white pop musicians have been criticized for cultural "
"appropriation and commercializing hip hop culture."
