"This tune is one of the RoR basics. It is (together with ‘Custard’) the RoR-"
"Tune which sounds most like “real” Samba."

"It is the tune with the most breaks (seven, not counting the tamb-stroke/"
"clave). And a lot of breaks also have nice bonuses. For example is every "
"break ended with a surdo pickup from either high-(1, 2 & 3) or low- (every "
"other break, sometimes even the clave & 4-pause) surdo. Also after the ‘SOS-"
"Break’ the repis should continue playing their part of the break until the "
"next break is called."

"Since practically every samba band can play a version of samba reggae, it is "
"a good tune to play together in demonstrations in which there are other non-"
"RoR samba bands."

"**Name:** Samba Reggae is the original afro-bloc rhythm, a mix of Samba and "
"Reggae that was invented by the black liberation movement in Brazil. Samba "
"reggae is a sub-genre of Samba, which arose in the context of afro-brazilian "
"people fighting for their right to play samba music and partake in Carnival "
"parades in the late 1960s. At that time only white people were allowed to "
"play in the parades for Carnival and in Samba schools of Rio de Janeiro. "
"Samba reggae is a Samba style, that developed because black people in Brazil "
"wanted to have a samba style to call their own. The music of the afro blocos "
"aimed to recreate and strengthen the afro-brazilian community. ([Wikipedia]"

"In “real” Samba, ‘samba reggae’ is a specific sub-genre, it’s not only in "
"terms of the rhythm, but also of the instruments, which are played (and how "
"they are played), different from other kinds of Samba. For example the Repi, "
"which is otherwise mostly hanging quite high and is played with a short "
"wooden stick and the hand, is hanging really low and is played with two long "
"plastic beaters."

"**Musical background:** The tune is a mix of Samba Reggae 1 & 3. RoR Samba "
"Reggae is played with mid surdo hitting in 1 and 3 beats and low one in 2 "
"and 4 (mid-low-mid-low,low), while most of the samba bands used to play with "
"low surdo in 1 and 3 and mid one in 2 and 4 (low-mid-low-mid,mid). Repi and "
"snare grooves use to be swapped too."

"**History:** Part of the first set of tunes taken from Barking Bateria in "
"2000. The tune sign used to be “smoking a joint”, as smoking joints is a "
"main ritual in the Rastafari religion, which is closely linked to Reggae "
"music. On the TNM 2024 it was decided to change the sign, as smoking weed is "
"also a racist stereotype associated with Black people."

"The rhythm clearly sounds like real Samba Reggae, which is a tune developed "
"and used by the Black liberation movement in Brazil. Many people in the RoR "
"network consider it cultural appropriation to play this tune in our mainly "
"white European bands, and there is an ongoing debate about abolishing the "
"tune."
