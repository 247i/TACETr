"<b>TRIfA - A New Kind of Instant Messaging</b><br>\n"
"\n"
"Whether it's corporations or governments, digital surveillance today is "
"widespread.<br>\n"
"Tox is easy-to-use software that connects you with friends and family "
"without anyone else listening in.<br>\n"
"While other big-name services require you to pay for features, Tox is "
"completely free and comes without advertising — forever.<br><br>\n"
"\n"
"<b>Encrypted:</b><br>\n"
"Everything you do with Tox is encrypted using open-source libraries. The "
"only people who can see your conversations are the people you're talking "
"with.<br><br>\n"
"\n"
"<b>Distributed:</b><br>\n"
"Tox has no central servers that can be raided, shut down, or forced to turn "
"over data — the network is made up of its users. Say goodbye to server "
"outages!<br><br>\n"
"\n"
"<b>Free:</b><br>\n"
"Tox is free software. That's free as in freedom, as well as in price. This "
"means Tox is yours — to use, modify, and share — because Tox is developed by "
"and for the users.<br><br>\n"
