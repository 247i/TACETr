"UniPatcher allows you to apply patches to game ROMs.\n"
"\n"
"What is a patch?\n"
"A file with the modified data of the game. For example, a game translated "
"from Japanese to English. You download the patch containing the translation. "
"It must be applied to the Japanese version to make an English version of it."
"\n"
"\n"
"This program will not help you hack native Android games, it was created for "
"the old console games (SNES, PS1, GBA, N64, SMD\\Genesis etc.)\n"
"\n"
"Features:\n"
"* Supported formats of patches: IPS, IPS32, UPS, BPS, APS (GBA), APS (N64), "
"PPF, DPS, EBP, XDelta3\n"
"* Create XDelta patches\n"
"* Fix the checksum in SMD\\Genesis ROMs\n"
"* Remove the SMC header from SNES ROMs\n"
"\n"
"How to use?\n"
"You have to select a ROM file, a patch and choose which file to save, then "
"click on the red round button. Files are selected through the standard Files "
"application (or through one of the file managers you have installed). The "
"application will show a message when the file is patched. Do not close the "
"application until the file is patched.\n"
"\n"
"Very important:\n"
"If the game and patch is compressed (ZIP, RAR, 7z or other), they first need "
"to be unzipped."

"never needed this function)\n"
