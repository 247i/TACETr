"**Name:** Coupé-Décalé is a type of club dance music popular in Côte d’"
"Ivoire. It was developed in Paris by Ivorian DJs and eventually brought back "
"to Côte d’Ivoire, where it became very popular. Some say that it represents "
"the desire of a young generation to bring more party, carefreeness and "
"openness to the world into a country shaped by its unstable political "
"situation and dominated by patriotic and military music. “Coupé-Décalé” "
"means something like “cheated somebody and then run away”, which is "
"generally interpreted to stand for famous Coupé-Décalé artists “tricking” "
"France and Western Europe to successful and famous there and then returning "
"to Côte d’Ivoire. ([Wikipedia]{1})"
