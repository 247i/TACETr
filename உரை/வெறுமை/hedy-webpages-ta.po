"Many schools and teachers around the world want to teach their students "
"programming. Initially this is often done with playful tools, ranging from "
"the Bee-Bot robot to\n"
"Scratch Junior or Scratch. After using such tools, kids often want to move "
"to more powerful, textual programming languages, like Python.\n"
"\n"
"Python however is hard, because it is only available in English, and "
"requires learners to learn complex programming concepts and syntax at once.\n"
"Hedy is the easy way to get started with textual programming languages! Hedy "
"is free to use, open source, and unlike any other textual programming "
"language in three ways.\n"
"\n"
"1. Hedy is multi-lingual, you can use Hedy in your own language\n"
"2. Hedy is gradual, so you can learn one concept and its syntax a time\n"
"3. Hedy is built for the classroom, allowing teachers to fully customize "
"their student's experience"

"Various teachers worldwide have expressed their passion for Hedy, as some "

"\n"
"*Incredibly inspiring! Super good way to make programming a lot more "
"accessible for yourself, but also for students. Very fun to play with and a "
"lot of potential to use with the students. I think it is a very nice tool! I "
"believe this is a valuable way for children to start learning programming. "
"Python and coding have always been very exciting, because the barrier to "
"learning is very high. Now everything is a bit lower and it was explained "
"that it can actually be very easy. I enjoyed seeing how Hedy tries to make "
"programming as accessible as possible for users!*\n"
"Netherlands: Mathematics teachers in training (secondary school)\n"
"\n"
"*Simple interface and good examples.* Teacher: 3rd - 6th grades (elementary)"
"\n"
"\n"
"*Multilingual programming and just the gradual programming concept itself.* "
"US: middle school, 6th-8th grade\n"
"\n"
"*The gradual nature of introducing programming.* Australia: High school\n"
"\n"
"*Continues automatically.* Netherlands: 2 HAVO-VWO\n"
"\n"
"*Both that the explanation can be in Dutch (and the code in English), and "
"that it builds up with more and more possibilities.* Netherlands: Plus class "
"group\n"
"\n"
"*But Hedy and its gradual levels...what an idea, I wanted to personally "
"thank you for creating this. I cannot thank you enough. Also, I have never "
"seen the level of engagement and enthusiasm of my students, as I have seen "
"with Hedy. We have covered till level 5, and plan to spend one more week on "
"it in classes and labs, before starting Python.* Pakistan\n"
"\n"
"*The 'realness' of programming, it resembles how it is in reality.* "
"Netherlands: Plus class group 4 to 8\n"
"\n"
"*Step-by-step activities. Fun activities.* Netherlands: 1e All levels, 2e "
"VWO/HAVO 2e VWO +, 3e HAVO 3e VWO\n"
"\n"
"*I really like Hedy very much and it is also nicely set up, which makes it "
"good to use in primary school. Hedy's gradual approach works very well. The "
"short explanation at the beginning of each level and the short example "
"programs help to give the children a quick insight into what is new in the "
"chosen level. The different assignments that the children can choose also "
"work very well. You see the children choose assignments that appeal to them "
"and they then get to work with them, through the levels. Hedy is great fun "
"for children who are good at programming and want to get a taste of a real "
"programming language. It is good preparation for secondary school as soon as "
"more ICT education is given there.* Netherlands: Oegstgeest Montessori "
