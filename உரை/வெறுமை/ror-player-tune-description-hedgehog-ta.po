"This tune is in a Tango-rhythm which goes along for 8 steps/two bars. Nearly "
"every instrument plays parts of the same rhythm. Therefore it’s easy to "
"learn."

"Hedgehog sounds great when it is played combined with ragga (a Tango-rhythm "
"too). As an example, just try introducing Ragga kick-backs or Zorro break "
"playing the groove pattern. Try continuing playing this break until a "
"Hedgehog break or similar is called."

"Both the Hedgehog call and Break 1 are stretched over 8 beats but the notes/"
"shouts only happen in the last 2 or 4 beats. It is important for the mestre "
"to count from the start of the 8 beats to get the timing right (marked with "
"\">\" on the notation). Everyone else keeps playing their normal rhythm "
"until they are counted in - don’t stop!"
