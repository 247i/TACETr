"This tune is really going forward: The Low Surdo is pushing with techno-like "
"damped hits, while the Repinique and Snare voices are one of the most fancy –"
" and also most difficult – ones in the RoR repertoire."

"One thing to note is that while most of the instruments have parts that are "
"played over 4 beats, the Surdos and Repi have a pattern played over 8. It is "
"important to call breaks etc. at the right time. The Repinique part is "
"rather hard as some notes are hit with a flare, some with the hand near the "
"rim of the drum, and some notes played on the rim. It takes a bit of "
"practice, but once you’ve got it, it sounds fantastic."

"The tamb part can be remembered by “1 2 3 4 What Are We Here For”. Be "
"careful though – it is quite easy if you’re not concentrating to slip into "
"the tam part of Custard. If you maestre, think about the tamb players. This "
"song can be very tiring for them so give them a break once in a while."

"**Name:** Afoxé can refer to a rhythm from brazilian carnival, a certain "
"kind of rattle from brazilian music, or a dance- and music formation in the "
"Carnival. All three meanings developed out of Candomblé, a creol religion "
"which evolved through slaves from West-Africa, who were forcefully brought "
"to South-America by white slave traders. The enslaved black people in Brazil "
"passed on the religious rites through generations. Candomblé is still "
"practiced by some afro-brazilians today. ([Wikipedia]{1})"

"Since this rhythm is directly rooted in Afro-Brazilian religion, many people "
"in the RoR network consider it cultural appropriation to play it. There is "
"an ongoing debate on whether this tune should be abandoned, and some bands "
"have already stopped playing it."

"There is also some criticism about the sign, since it ridicules the "
"spiritual meaning of the rhythm, and shaving the armpits is a loaded topic "
