msgctxt "algorithmExplanation"
msgid ""
"An algorithm is a set of rules that takes in one or more inputs, then "
"performs inner calculations and data manipulations and returns an output or "
"a set of outputs. In short, algorithms make life easy. From complex data "
"manipulations and hashes, to simple arithmetic, algorithms follow a set of "
"steps to produce a useful result. One example of an algorithm would be a "
"simple function that takes two input values, adds them together, and returns "
"their sum."
