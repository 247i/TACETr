#. It is comparable to a ticket in the real world. When you book a flight to
#. fly from one destination to another, you will buy a ticket. Different
#. random codes on this ticket indicate that you purchased the ticket. Since
#. these codes are stored with the airline, you cannot fake a ticket. The
