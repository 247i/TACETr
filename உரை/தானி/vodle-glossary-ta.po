#. In contrast to the *verb* "to vote", the noun "vote" is admissible. In

#. In vodle, we use the verb "approve" exclusively to refer to the act of
#. approving an option in the sense of endorsing it or agreeing to its
#. adoption as a formal act. We do *not* use the phrase "approve OF an
#. option", which would instead refer to a state of mind similar to liking or
#. preferring the option. Formally approving an option in vodle might or might
#. not relate to approving OF the option in one's mind because approving an
#. option might be a strategic act in order to move the group towards a better
#. compromise.
#. Participants can either approve or disapprove options directly, or can
#. indirectly influence whether they will eventually approve or disapprove an
#. option by stating their willingness to approve (see "wap").

#. "Options" are what participants collectively decide on in a vodle poll.
#. Depending on the type of poll, the collective decision will either pick
#. exactly one "option", or a fixed number of "options", or will distribute
#. some budged across "options".
#. We use the generic term "option" instead of the more specific terms
#. "alternative", "candidate", "project", "recipient", etc. because the latter
#. are only appropriate in certain types of decisions and not in others. E.g.,
#. "alternative" is not suitable when a budget is distributed, "candidate"
#. would suggest that the options are human beings, etc.

#. A "participant" is a person participating in a vodle poll by setting "waps"
#. and/or "delegating".
#. We prefer the term "participant" to the alternative term "voter" to
#. emphasize the interactive nature of participating in vodle polls which is
#. more than just voting once.
#, terminology

#. DO NOT TRANSLATE unless absolutely necessary.
#. Waps are the most important concept in vodle. A participant's "wap" for an
#. option is their "Willingness to APprove" that option, represented by a
#. number between 0 and 100. So the "wap" determines whether the participant
#. "approves" an option or not (see "approve" for comparison). A "wap" of 17
#. means that the participant will approve if and only if less than 17% of all
#. participants disapprove the option.
#. Therefore, a "wap" is *not* a rating or evaluation of an option. Rather, it
#. has an inherent negotiation or bargaining aspect that "rating" or
#. "evaluation" has not. In most languages, there will not be a single word
#. conveying this difference sufficiently clearly.
#. Thus, in order to avoid the confusion with "rating" or "evaluation", and to
#. signal the importance of this concept, we suggest to keep the word "wap"
#. unless it sounds unacceptably strange or invokes misleading associations in
#. the target language.
#, read-only, terminology

msgid "wap (INVENTED WORD)"

#. We use the term "poll" to refer to the process of reaching a binding
#. collective decision, as in this Merriam-Webster entry under 4a(1):
#. https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/poll.  An synonym would be
#. "referendum".
#. We avoid the alternative term "decision" since that might suggest that a
#. decision has already been taken. We avoid "vote" since that might suggest
#. that it is a one-time voting rather than an interactive process like vodle.
#. "poll" does *not* refer to a mere elicitation of opinions without a
#. decision in the end, like a "survey".
